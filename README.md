# MyFundTracker
Developed a simulated mutual fund investment dashboard that mimics real-world workflows using JWT-based login, CAS file parsing, and mock APIs to replicate CAMS, KFintech, and NSEMF data. Demonstrated folio mapping, KYC validation, and secure portfolio viewing using React and Node.js.
